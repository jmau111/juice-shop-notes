## Warnings

These are my real notes. There are solutions, opinions, and errors explained.

I strongly encourage you to hack the shop without reading any solution unless you are totally blocked. I've spend a lot of time solving some of the challenges. I had to make numerous attempts. 

"Perform a persisted XSS attack bypassing a client-side security mechanism" took me like forever!

If you're stucked, give up for today and go back tomorrow or another day. I believe such mindset allows you to learn and be rewarded.

## Best features 

* coding challenges to secure the flawed app (it's not just about attacking!)
* highly educational
* brilliant scenarios, you won't be bored
* 6 levels that allow a real progression

## What you may consider as inconvenients

* don't forget to save your progression regularly after discovering the score board!
* best documentation is OWASP itself. While you can find hints elsewhere, it's often way quicker to stick with OWASP
* the tools determine the whole experience (nightmare vs. super fun), and your choices have to match the ones maintainers have in mind!
* IMHO, you won't be able to solve everything in one session*

_* Feel free to disagree with me, but I don't see how someone can solve some challenges without time-consuming researches_

## TODO

* 3 4-stars challenges
* 3 5-stars challenges
* 9 6-stars challenges

## Current target

=> challenge 999

## Warnings

These are my real notes. There are solutions, opinions, and errors explained.

I strongly encourage you to hack the shop without reading any solution unless you are totally blocked. I've spend a lot of time solving some of the challenges. I had to make numerous attempts. 

"Perform a persisted XSS attack bypassing a client-side security mechanism" took me like forever!

If you're stucked, give up for today and go back tomorrow or another day. I believe such mindset allows you to learn and be rewarded.

Coding challenges are a great support to learn how to secure a flawed app.

Best documentation is OWASP itself, but you can find hints elsewhere...
